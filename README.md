# Agrobot
Agrobot contributes significantly to the modernization of agriculture by enhancing productivity, scalability, and precision farming practices. Beyond its role in automating fruit picking, the robot provides real-time data that enables farmers to optimize resource use and reduce environmental impact. The incorporation of robotics in agriculture, exemplified by Agrobot, showcases the transformative potential of technology in revolutionizing traditional farming methods. By alleviating labour constraints, enhancing efficiency, and promoting sustainable practices, Agrobot symbolizes a shift towards a more resilient, productive, and environmentally conscious future for the agricultural sector.

Our project aims to design and implement a robot capable of identifying and selectively picking ripe fruits from trees and collecting them in a bin, streamlining the harvesting process and reducing the reliance on manual labour. This is done by integrating a manipulator arm (UR-10) into a mobile robot.

Robot Type:
The Agrobot is a mobile robot designed for various applications, equipped with specific features that
enhance its functionality. Here's an elaboration on its key components and capabilities:

Mobile Platform: The robot is equipped with a 4-wheel drive system, providing stability and
manoeuvrability on different surfaces. This configuration allows the robot to navigate through various
environments with ease.

Steering System: The Agrobot features front two steering wheels, which enable precise control over its
movement. This design facilitates better navigation and enables the robot to navigate around obstacles or
tight spaces.

Robotic Arm - UR10: The robot is equipped with a Universal Robots UR10 robotic arm. This robotic arm
adds a high degree of flexibility and versatility to the robot's capabilities. The UR10 arm is known for its
precision and ability to perform a wide range of tasks..

Degrees of Freedom (DOF): The UR10 robotic arm provides six degrees of freedom, allowing the robot to
move its arm in six different directions. This high level of freedom enables the robot to reach and manipulate
objects in a three-dimensional space with great precision.

End Effector - Vacuum Gripper: The end effector of the robotic arm is a vacuum gripper. A vacuum
gripper is a specialized tool designed for gripping and handling objects using suction. This type of gripper is
particularly useful for picking up items of varying shapes, sizes, and materials, making it suitable for a wide
range of applications.

A specialized Inverse Kinematics algorithm is being developed for Agrobot to mitigate singularities and enhance operational speed.
